# Brain-Tumor-Prediction Project

This repository contains project file of Brain Tumor detection along with its image dataset which has a total of 253 images labelled as "yes" and "no". 

## Objective

The main objective behind this project is to detect brain tumor by using Convolutional Neural Network from the MRI images which are taken as the input and classify them into 2 categories- "Yes" or "No".

## About Dataset:

We have collected our dataset from Kaggle and the link for the dataset is given below:
https://www.kaggle.com/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection

Our image dataset has two folders:
• Yes folder – It consists of 155 images of "yes" category 
• No folder – It consists of 98 images of "no" category.

We have also performed the Data Augumentation on the dataset to compensate for the less amount of data. Data augmentation in data analysis are techniques used to increase the amount of data by adding slightly modified copies of already existing data.

-> Before augmentation: Total images: 253 images  <br>
-> After augmentation: Total images: 2065 images


## About CNN model 
Convolution Neural Network is an algorithm that is used in our project,for the identification of 2D image and to get information from it. It has mainly has the following layers: input layer, zero padding layer,convolution layer, max pooling layer, and fully connected layer. It require less preprocessing as compare to other image classification algorithm.

## Building of model
We have used Convolution Neural Network to build the deep learning model for image analysis, pattern detection and classification problems as well. It has various layers such as Convolution layer, Pooling Layer and Fully connected layer.

  > + a. Convolution Layer <br>
   It receives the input from input layer and output the transformed input to the next layer. We specify the filters along with the layers to detect the patterns . These filters are matrix of small size and filters will slide over each set of pixels of image until entire image is covered. This sliding process is called as convolving and then dot product of the filter with each block of pixels of image from the input is computed. In this way, features are extracted from the image and reduce the dimensions of the array containing the pixels values of the image.

  > + b.  Pooling Layer  <br>
  It is used to reduce the dimensions of the featured maps generated by the convolution layer and this layer containing the most prominent features of the previous feature map.

  > + Stride is a parameter of the neural network's filter that modifies the amount of movement over the image.

  <br>

  > + Flattening process:  <br>
  Flattening is applied to convert the pooled featured map into a 1-d array and inserted to the final classification model, which is called a fully-connected layer.

  > + c. Fully Connected Layer <br>
  Then the flattened array obtained after the flattening process will be passed to fully-connected neural network.

## Accuracy
As a result, we got an accuracy of 92% through binary classification.
Our model predicts the images as shown below:
